## Abstract

While large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance in question-
answering tasks, their performance is limited
when the questions require knowledge that is not
included in the modelâ€™s training data and can
only be acquired through direct observation or
interaction with the real world. Existing meth-
ods decompose reasoning tasks through the use
of modules invoked sequentially, limiting their
ability to answer deep reasoning tasks. We intro-
duce a method, Recursion based extensible LLM
(REBEL), which handles open-world, deep rea-
soning tasks by employing automated reasoning
techniques like dynamic planning and forward-
chaining strategies. REBEL allows LLMs to rea-
son via recursive problem decomposition and uti-
lization of external tools. The tools that REBEL
uses are specified only by natural language de-
scription. We further demonstrate REBEL capa-
bilities on a set of problems that require a deeply
nested use of external tools in a compositional
and conversational setting.
