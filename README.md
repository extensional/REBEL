## Abstract

While large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance in question-
answering tasks, their performance is limited
when the questions require knowledge that is not
included in the model’s training data and can
only be acquired through direct observation or
interaction with the real world. Existing meth-
ods decompose reasoning tasks through the use
of modules invoked sequentially, limiting their
ability to answer deep reasoning tasks. We intro-
duce a method, Recursion based extensible LLM
(REBEL), which handles open-world, deep rea-
soning tasks by employing automated reasoning
techniques like dynamic planning and forward-
chaining strategies. REBEL allows LLMs to rea-
son via recursive problem decomposition and uti-
lization of external tools. The tools that REBEL
uses are specified only by natural language de-
scription. We further demonstrate REBEL capa-
bilities on a set of problems that require a deeply
nested use of external tools in a compositional
and conversational setting.

## Performance Charts

The following charts display the performance of different algorithms against various data sets:

| Algorithm    | Data Set 1 | Data Set 2 | Data Set 3 |
|--------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Algorithm A  | 85%        | 70%        | 92%        |
| Algorithm B  | 75%        | 82%        | 78%        |
| Algorithm C  | 90%        | 88%        | 85%        |

The chart represents the percentage of accuracy achieved by each algorithm.
